# Traefik

Create a file named `.env`. Fill out with:
```env
auth='auth'
```

The auth string can be generated by `htpasswd -nb user pass`. Needs single quotes around content to work. 
This is used to secure the dashboard.

Next: make a new folder called config, with this structure
```sh
config
|
|-- file-providers # Used for basic config.
|
`-- traefik.yml # Static config. More later 
```

This structure can be setup automatically, using the script `setup.sh`.

There is an example traefik config in this directory. For the most part this should work, but make sure you go through and fill in all the placeholders (`REPLACE_ME`).

The file providers directory is enaqbled by default. You may stick whatever [config](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/dynamic-configuration/file/) you want in there.
