# Docker Compose Files

This repo contains the docker compose files for my systems.

Looking at each directory there is a `docker-compose.yml` file in it. 
There may also be a `setup.md` with steps to set everything up.

After following the setup document, or if there is none, you may run `docker compose up -d` 
in the directory to run the service.
